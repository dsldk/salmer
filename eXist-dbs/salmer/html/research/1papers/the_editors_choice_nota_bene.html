                <p>The article is concerned with discussing the role of the encoder of musical
                    notation and with exploring how to make choices when encoding. A central point
                    is that decision-making is to a large extent dependent on the purpose of the
                    encoding. Consequently, the editor needs to take into consideration who is going
                    to use the encoding and how. Taking its point of departure from an ongoing
                    project on sixteenth-century monophonic songs, the article discusses the
                    relationship between the visual appearance of notation and the meaning of it.
                    Furthermore, the article explores how an editor is able to address problems
                    during the interpretation and presentation of the source by employing Music
                    Encoding Initiative (MEI). </p>
